      <p>Almost every new client these days wants a mobile version of their website. 
         It’s practically essential after all: onedesign for the BlackBerry, another 
         for the iPhone, the iPad, netbook, Kindle — and all screen resolutions must 
         be compatible, too. In the next five years, we’ll likely need to design for 
         a number of additional inventions. When will the madness stop? It won’t, of 
         course.In the field of Web design and development, we’re quickly getting to 
         the point of being unable to keep up with the endless new resolutions and devices.
         For many websites, creating a website version for each resolution and new device 
         would be impossible, or at least impractical. Should we just suffer the consequences 
         of losing visitors from one device, for the benefit of gaining visitors from another? 
         Or is there another option?</p>
